# exe-cs61a-2011spring

Made this thanks to www.teachyourselfcs.com

These are my some of my solution towards CS61A Spring 2011 Brian Harvey's homeworks.

Managed to found some resources from https://github.com/theurere/berkeley_cs61a_spring-2011_archive
The courses videos https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E

My advice for everyone who are getting into programming :
1. Google "The Odin Projects", then learn every single sh*ts from it. 
(the Git, Github part is really powerful to learn)

2. Alongside or after finished "TOP", go to www.teachyourselfcs.com

Good Luck !
